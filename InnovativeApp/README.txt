Done the below requirements:
  *Created a TO-DO list app using django Framework which contains the fields such as Title, Description, Date and Time,
Status, Created at and also Modified date.
  *This App should handle all the CRUD Operations and view all the list in Form.
  *I have added Custom Search button to filter particular Task_Id.
  *In Admin page we are able to download CSV files.
  *Created function to extract all items and individuals items without using API Framework.
  *Created Django admin interface for this so that an admin user can login and add the entries.
